## About Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking and knowledge management application that allows you to create, organize, and connect your thoughts, ideas, and information in a non-linear manner. It uses a combination of plain text files, Markdown formatting, and backlinking to create an interconnected web of notes that can be easily navigated and referenced.
